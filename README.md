This repository contains example code demonstrating a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers, specifically when the list is empty or contains zero values. The `bug.py` file shows the initial incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version with robust error handling and edge case considerations.  The code is designed to be easily understandable and helps illustrate best practices for handling potential errors.
